# Introduction #

This project investigates the interconnectedness of commodity markets by focusing on the relationships between precious and industrial metals and energy resources. Specifically, it explores the question:

> **Can the price of gold be predicted using the prices of other major commodities such as silver, copper, crude oil, and natural gas?**

The dataset used, `commodities_12_22.csv`, contains **3,259 rows** of daily commodity price data spanning from June 2009 to December 2022. The columns relevant to this question include:

- **Gold** – price per ounce in USD  
- **Silver** – price per ounce in USD  
- **Copper** – price per pound in USD  
- **Crude Oil** – price per barrel (WTI benchmark)  
- **Brent Oil** – international oil benchmark price per barrel  
- **Natural Gas** – Henry Hub spot price per MMBtu  

Understanding these relationships is valuable not only for economic forecasting and financial modeling, but also for traders, analysts, and policymakers who rely on accurate indicators of market movement and inflation-sensitive assets.
